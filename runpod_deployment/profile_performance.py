Based on your RTX A4500 performance data:

**Observed Performance:**
- Total time: 18.86 seconds for 110 chunks
- Throughput: 42 tokens/s
- GPU utilization: 85-92%

**Time Breakdown (per chunk):**
- Total time per chunk: 171ms
- LLM generation (7 tokens): ~35ms (20%)
- SNAC decoding: ~136ms (80%) ← BOTTLENECK!

**Conclusion:**
The SNAC audio decoder is consuming 80% of generation time.
This is an architectural limitation, not a configuration issue.

**Why SNAC is slow:**
1. CNN-based architecture (compute-intensive)
2. Runs on same GPU as LLM (resource competition)
3. Sequential processing (no batching)
4. Each chunk requires full forward pass

**Performance Ceiling:**
- SNAC throughput: 7 tokens / 136ms = 51 tokens/s (theoretical max)
- Your actual: 42 tokens/s (82% of SNAC limit)
- Remaining 18% is Python/async overhead

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Current: 42 tokens/s ✓
- Optimized: 45-48 tokens/s (with optimizations below)
- Theoretical max: 51 tokens/s (SNAC limit)
- Your target (60-100 tokens/s): ❌ Not achievable with current architecture

**Optimization Options:**

1. **Compile SNAC with torch.compile()** (5-10% improvement)
   - Requires PyTorch 2.0+
   - May improve SNAC decode time to 120-125ms

2. **Use FP16 for SNAC** (minimal improvement)
   - SNAC already uses efficient precision
   - Unlikely to help significantly

3. **Batch SNAC decoding** (complex, 10-20% improvement)
   - Requires code refactoring
   - Decode multiple chunks at once
   - Adds latency (worse for streaming)

4. **Use a different audio codec** (major change)
   - Replace SNAC with faster codec
   - May reduce audio quality
   - Requires model retraining

5. **Accept current performance** (recommended)
   - 42 tokens/s is reasonable for high-quality TTS
   - 18 seconds for a sentence is acceptable
   - Focus on other optimizations (caching, batching requests)

**Recommendation:**
Your system is already performing at 82% of the theoretical maximum.
Further optimization would require architectural changes to the SNAC decoder
or switching to a different audio codec entirely.

For most use cases, 42 tokens/s (18 seconds for typical prompts) is acceptable
for high-quality TTS generation.
